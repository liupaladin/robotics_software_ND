## Introduction
This folder is for project one. The space created is a typical single floor type plan. I put two four wheel robots and one three wheel robots inside. 

## Instruction
- To build the script for plugin, please follow the following steps:
  - `mkdir build && cd build`
  - `cmake ../`
  - `make`
  - `export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}:/Users/jingxuanliu/workspace/robotics_software_ND/simulation_gazebo/project_1_build_my_world/build`

- To load the gazebo world for project 1, navigate to simulation_gazebo/project_1_build_my_world/world and then use command `gazebo project_1_single_floor_env` in any terminal.

- The model files are stored inside the model folder. The building is also stored in model folder as instructerd with name "robot_house_space".
